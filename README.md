# DV-Djikstra
Dick Van Dijk-Stra (aka D.V. for Dijkstra)



note: It's currently buggy and only goes toward the last target because the onCollision function I wrote broke and I had to revert to a save file. My group is leaving for CA in ten minutes, so I'll clean it up for the Project version on the 17th.  -ZG

note pt 2: the scripts are in the Assets folder - I need to rework my arrive function so that it will actually collide with the waypoint instead of stopping and looking at it. Then I need to rewrite the onCollision function so it switches targets after it hits the waypoints. Then I have to make it look nice.

note pt3: Turns out the camera sees nothing, so the build doesn't help at all. SOrry.
